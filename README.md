## Overview

The program was designed to improve the existing algorithmic trading systems and maintain the firmâ€™s competitive advantage in the market. In order to enhance the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data, the following was accomplished...

* Establish a Baseline Performance

* Tune the Baseline Trading Algorithm

* Evaluate a New Machine Learning Classifier

* Create an Evaluation Report

## Requirements

This project leverages python 3.7 and scikit-learn.

A [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment with liabraries listed below and [Jupyter Notebook/Lab](https://jupyter.org/) are required to run the code.

The following library was used:

1. [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) - Scikit Learn or Sklearn is one of the most used Python libraries for Data Science, along with others like Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow, or Keras.


Install the following librarie(s) in your terminal...

    pip install -U scikit-learn

## Data

The data used in this neural network model was from derived from a CSV file called emerging_markets_ohlcv.csv:
